# Web-scraping-challenge

For this project, data was scraped using Beautiful Soup, Splinter, and the Pandas library. This data was then returned as a Python dictionary, which was then passed into a Mongo database. Lastly, this data was used to build a Flask application that queried the Mongo database and displayed the data scraped in an html template.
